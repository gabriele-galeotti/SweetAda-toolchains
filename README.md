SweetAda toolchains

This is a (redirection) repository for various GNU/GNAT toolchains.

Huge files are not easily uploadable in Github, so follow the links and
download the toolchains directly from the SweetAda web site. Connection
maybe very slow.

Packages with .zip extension are suitable for a W64 environment. Unpack the
package in a subdirectory, e.g. "C:\Program Files\GNAT". If you want to use
the toolchain in SweetAda, specify this directory in the configuration.in
file.
