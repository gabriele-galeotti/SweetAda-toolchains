SweetAda toolchains

This is a repository for various GNU/GNAT toolchains.

Packages in the MinGW64 directory have a .zip extension and are suitable for a
W64 environment. Unpack the package in a subdirectory like "C:\Program Files\GNAT".
If you want to use the toolchain in SweetAda, specify this directory in the
configuration.in file.
